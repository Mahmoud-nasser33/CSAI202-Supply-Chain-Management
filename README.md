## 🔌 Database Connectivity Guide

### 1. Connection String Configuration
Navigate to `SupplyChainSystem\SupplyChain.Backend\appsettings.json` and update the `DefaultConnection` string with your server details:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=SupplyChainDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

### 2. Schema Setup
Run the provided SQL scripts in the following order using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio:
1. `SQL_1_CREATE_SCHEMA.sql`
2. `SQL_2_INSERT_DATA.sql`

Alternatively, use `SQL_CLEAN_SETUP.sql` for a fresh installation.

### ❓ Why are my numbers showing as "0"?
If the dashboard or pages display **0** for statistics (e.g., 0 Customers, 0 Orders):
- **Unconnected Database**: The frontend is gracefully handling the absence of data. Ensure the Backend API is running and successfully connected to the SQL database.
- **Empty Tables**: If the scripts were not run, there is no data to aggregate. Please ensure the `INSERT_DATA` script has been executed.
